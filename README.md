#1.Starting with the first task, so about 'Git' - It is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files. It is generally used for source
code management in software development and a distributed version control system(DVCS) commonly functioning as a stock exchange like properties for developers where 
every individuals can share, create, copy, add and many more to a technical parameters for a whole or a particular set of data which can be a set of code or either 
a single translation
of such data for development purpose.
#2.Further more if we dive deep into the key functions of GitHub, lets assume there's a MNC or a large business organization where every individual or an employee 
work on a fragment of task and finally which needs to be compiled as a whole new set from an individual to be clearly framed as a one. For an instance a software 
company leading various kind of developers working on different parameters and every change or regulation made by individual's work must be regulated throughout the
team and for that we need a distributed controlling system where a virtual change could be made easily and through which work regulation could be more deliquiate 
which may reduce time frame of the work and help in connecting work premises in a more enhanced way.
#3.We use different strategies to manage the complexity of software development and with each approach balances stability and flexibility of the software. As for such
indulgence GitHub provides a perfect platform for the developers to be engaged in the arena of software development and share more visuals insights of data bonding 
and connecting with exact modification of the data provided by the user. Thus, after going through various measures and understanding the fundamental use of 
git i finally understand that it is a software tool that helps to track changes in code and with regards to its accessibility  making it free, open source, fast and 
also scalable by providing its major application for collaboration.
